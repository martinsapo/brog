DETAILS
-------

The main reason behind this project are the author motivation to move from shared hosting to something better. What is better that free hosting at github pages?

Also, as Wordpress is moving further away from being a simple blog engine, it has grown to a big and clunky by its default setting. Author like to challenge himself by creating something better. Thus, Brog is intended to be small and focused, as a warm friend that always bring joy to writers.

Brog is writer first, reader second.

However, the focus user right now is author himself, a developer first and writer second.
